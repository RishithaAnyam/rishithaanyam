LeetCode - 168 --> Excel Sheet Column Title

Explanation --> Here we simply decrement the column number and find the remainder when it is divided by 6 then add it to 'A',ascii value of 'A'is 65 now the remaindr is added to ascii value.
                hence that is finally converted into character ,then that character is inserted into stringbuilder object,now divide columnumber with 26.

class Solution {
    public String convertToTitle(int columnNumber) 
    {
        StringBuilder sb=new StringBuilder();
        while(columnNumber>0)
        {
            columnNumber--;
            char c=((char)('A'+columnNumber%26));
            sb.insert(0,c);
            columnNumber/=26;
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
