LeetCode - 7 --> Reverse Integer

Explanation ---> the last digit is obtaied as x%10 and stored in a variable to which 10 is multiplied such that it occupies its position then x is divided by 10 so that
                next digit can be obtained in the number then we check if the number is less than min value or greater than max value of integer ,return 0 other wise 
                we return the reversed value

class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {
        long s=0;
        while(x!=0)
        {
            int p=x%10;
            s+=p;
            s=s*10;
            x=x/10;
        }
        s=s/10;
        if(s>Integer.MAX_VALUE || s<Integer.MIN_VALUE)
        return 0;
        if(x<0)
        {
            return(int) (-1*s);
        }
        return (int)s;
        }
        
    }
